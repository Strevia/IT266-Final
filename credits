This is a mod for Quake 2 that adds several mechanics from Among Us, 
Town of Salem, and other similiar style games to Quake 2. Added features include

GHOST MODE: If you die during a death match, you enter ghost mode. 
In ghost mode, you can fly around the map.

VOTING: You can begin a vote by typing the command "vote start". 
During an ongoing vote, any player can type "vote <number>" 
to vote for a player. 
A vote can be ended by typing the command "vote end". 
Once a vote ends, the player with the most votes will die.

ROLES: Five roles have been added. 
To assume a role, type the command "role <number>". 
To activate a role, type the command "role activate", or press r. 
The roles added include:

1. Mafioso, who can kill non-town players.

2. Sheriff, who can attempt to arrest a player. If this player is a mafia, 
they will die. If the player is town, the sheriff will die.

4. Veteran, who can go on "alert". 
While on alert, any player who interacts with the veteran will die,
and the veteran cannot be killed.

6. Doctor, who can heal a player. 
While a player is healed, they cannot be attacked.

8. Investigator, who can investigate a player. 
This will tell the investigator whether the player is good or evil.
(Note with roles: 0 is considered a generic town role, 
while odd numbers between 3 and 7 are considered generic mafia roles).

MINIGAMES: Five minigames have been added. 
These can be played via the command "mini <name_of_minigame>". 
These include:

files: Stand still and wait for a file to be downloaded and then uploaded. 
This minigame succeeds once the file is fully uploaded,
and fails if the player moves before then.

code: A code will appear on screen consisting of the letters M and N. 
Type them in the correct order to succeed. 
This minigame fails if the player types an incorrect key.

temp: A desired temperature and a current temeprature will appear on screen. 
Using the M key to make the current temperature go up
and N key to make it go down, make them equal. 
This minigame has no failure condition.

fuel: Empty the fuel gauge by pressing M the desired number of times. 
This minigame does not fail.
count: Press M the correct number of times, then press N to confirm. 
Fails if M is pressed an incorrect number of times.
